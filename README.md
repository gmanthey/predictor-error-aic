# The unexpected consequences of predictor error in ecological model selection

This is a repository of code that goes alongside the paper "The unexpected consequences of predictor error in ecological model selection" currently in preprint on bioarxiv. Each of the ipython notebooks in this repository reproduces one or more of the plots in the paper. Figure 1 is produced by `beta_residuals.ipynb`, Figure 2 and 4 by `correct_simulation.ipynb` and Figure 3 by `case_study.ipynb`. 

## Installation

Running the notebooks requires 
  - numpy
  - matplotlib 
  - pandas
  - ipykernel
