# The unexpected consequences of predictor error in ecological model selection

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/655234898.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10256473)

This is a repository of code that goes alongside the paper "The unexpected consequences of predictor error in ecological model selection" currently in preprint on bioarxiv. Each of the ipython notebooks in this repository reproduces one or more of the plots in the paper. Figure 1 is produced by `Meta variables.ipynb`, Figure 2 and 4 by `Simulation.ipynb` and Figure 3 by `Case study.ipynb`. 

## Installation

Running the notebooks requires 
  - numpy
  - matplotlib 
  - pandas
  - ipykernel

## Acknowledgements

This code uses data from the Climate Data Center from the German weather service (DWD).
